                <p>I'm a 24 year old furry artist that draws and 3D models! I enjoy both of those as my main hobby, as well as playing some fun non-competitive video games :3. 
                    I enjoy listening to Weezer and Asian Kung-Fu Generation as I draw or model. Here's my music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOUrNhj-yDbp0K3fADH-rQC5VyOjcYHkz">playlist.</a>
                    <br>In case you didn't quite notice, this website was made by me ;3! Web development is just a small skill I picked up as a hobby back in 2018, thanks to my friend that moved to China.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Originally, I was a furry hater. I found them quite cringe, (still do sometimes) and was quite judgemental. Back in 2018 when I was 17, I bought this cool game called A Hat in Time.
                    I had bought it around the same time I was playing Mario Odyssey, and completely stopped playing Odyssey in favor of this game. Eventually, the time came when they released a new DLC for A Hat in Time,
                    Nyakuza metro. It's a little weeby type Yakuza train metro map. I found it incredibly fun. After that DLC was released, and I had finished it, the A Hat in Time community Discord hosted
                    a mod jam! This was my first experience with making game mods. I really enjoyed the little cat ears and mask that Hat Kid had to wear in that DLC, so I decided to make a mod that changed
                    all of her hats to be the same as that.
                    <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1749604214">Here</a> is that mod.
                    Eventually, in order to get it looking good for the fox mask flair, I had to poke around in Blender and edit a 3D model ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±
                    <br>
                    So that was a little scary, since I had used Blender once before when I was 13, and I had no clue what I was doing. But the community helped me out! They were so cool and patient with me.
                    You can see the before and after pictures on the steam mod page I linked earlier, one showing green glowing oval eye shapes, then finally the triangle shapes around the cat ears.
                    <br>
                    After making a bunch of mods, my sister gifted the game OneShot to me. I won't go too far into the details, but I really enjoyed the game, and HAD to make a 3D model of Niko. I added them
                    into A Hat in Time, and it got a few thousand subscribers :^). That made me pretty happy. 
                    <br>
                    I continued to model characters, including my own.
                    <br>
                    All during that time of modeling and modding, I made a "sona". It wasn't really furry, at least I denied it for so long since he had human skin still, but he was a mix between a cat and a bird, and was mostly furless.
                    <br>
                    I was a big furry denier in '21. Eventually, I decided that I didn't really want to draw feathers anymore, since that was difficult, so I made him just all cat. And very blue and full of fur.
                    For those who care, this is how I got to what I do now!
