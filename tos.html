                                But, I would rather not have them in any NSFW outfits or situations. Otherwise, feel free to draw my characters how you'd like!

                                It also goes without saying, that any fanart made with generative AI is not allowed, and I would appreciate any and all effort put into using any other art medium you may choose!
                                <br>
                                Traditional, Digital, 3D? I'd love to see it :D!

                                While I can't really control what you do with the 3D model after I finish it, there are some things I don't allow.

                            <h5>Do NOT</h5>
                            <p>
                                Use my 3D models as a base for picture to picture generative AI.
                                <br>
                                Sell or mint as an NFT.
                                <br>
                                Distribute the model as a paid model. (If you'd like to as a business partner, I would prefer I get a percentage of the money.)
                            </p>
                            <h5>You may</h5>
                            <p>
                                Create animations with your model.

                                Use in NSFW situations.
                                <br>
                                Resell the model (If you are selling the rights to the character).

                    Refunds
                </h5>
                <p>I will only accept payment before I begin work, and as such, things may come up on your end where you might need that money back. 
                    If that sort of situation does come up, and I haven't started any work on your commission, you can expect a 100% refund. 
                    As for if I start a sketch, if I am in the beginning stages, you can still expect a full refund. If I complete the sketch, I can only give 70% for my time.
                <br>
                    As for 3D model commissions, I will only refund you if the afformentioned situation occurs before I start work, all the way up to finishing modeling the head. 
                </p>
                <h5>REMEMBER</h5>
                <p>Communication is key! If you don't like how the commission is turning out, tell me! I will allow up to 2 revisions on drawing, and 5-10 on 3D models.
                    If you feel I am taking too long to start on a commission, you may also ask and expect a full refund.
                    <br>
                    One more thing I would like to mention is, if I feel like I am unable to complete your commission, or if it is taking a very long time for me to complete it, 
                    I will give you a 100% refund on my own.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    When you commission me, you confirm you have read through my T.O.S., and understand it completely.
